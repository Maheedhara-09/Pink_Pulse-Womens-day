                <h3> What is Menstruation?</h3>
                <p>Menstruation, also known as a period, is a normal and natural part of growing up for girls. It's something that happens inside their bodies as they become teenagers.</p>

                <h3>Why It Happens:</h3>
                <p>Each month, a girl's body prepares for a possible baby by making the lining of the uterus thick and cozy. If there's no baby, the body sheds this lining as blood.</p>

                <p>The blood leaves the body through the vagina. This process usually lasts 3 to 7 days and happens once a month.</p>
