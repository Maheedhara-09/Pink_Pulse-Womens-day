                <h2>Phases of Menstrual Cycle</h2>
                <p>The menstrual cycle has four phases, and each phase affects the body differently. Hereâ€™s a simple way to understand them, along with diet and exercise tips for each phase.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                <h3>1) Menstrual Phase (Period Days - 3 to 7 days)</h3>
                <p>What Happens? The body sheds the uterine lining, and bleeding occurs. Energy levels may be low.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diet: Eat iron-rich foods like spinach, lentils, and dates to make up for blood loss. Drink warm soups and herbal teas to ease cramps.</li>
                    <li>Exercise: Do light activities like walking, stretching, or gentle yoga to help with cramps and bloating.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                <h3>2) Follicular Phase (After Period - 7 to 10 days)</h3>
                <p>What Happens? The body starts preparing a new egg, and energy levels rise. Mood improves.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diet: Eat protein-rich foods like eggs, fish, and nuts. Include leafy greens and berries for vitamins.</li>
                    <li>Exercise: Strength training, cardio workouts, and running are great since energy is high.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                <h3>3) Ovulation Phase (Middle of the Cycle - 3 to 5 days)</h3>
                <p>What Happens? The body releases an egg, and energy is at its peak. You may feel your best.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diet: Eat zinc-rich foods like pumpkin seeds and seafood. Stay hydrated and eat fresh fruits.</li>
                    <li>Exercise: High-intensity workouts, dancing, or sports are great as the body feels strong.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                <h3>4) Luteal Phase (Before Period - 10 to 14 days)</h3>
                <p>What Happens? Hormones change, and PMS symptoms like mood swings or cravings may appear. Energy may drop.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diet: Eat magnesium-rich foods like dark chocolate, bananas, and nuts to reduce bloating and mood swings. Reduce salty and sugary foods.</li>
                    <li>Exercise: Do yoga, pilates, or light workouts to manage stress and bloating. Avoid heavy workouts if feeling tired.</li>
